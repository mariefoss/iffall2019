				Aldo Gucci expanded into new markets including an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC). The automaker merged the worlds of couture and automobiles with the Gucci version of the AMC Hornet. Starting in October 1971, the 1972 and 1973 model year Hornet compact "Sportabout" station wagons became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a famous fashion designer.

						Although coming from Italy where sleek sports cars are more revered, Gucci put his special touch efforts on the Hornet station wagon with a rear lift gate and 60.8 cubic feet (1,722 l) of cargo space inside. In contrast to ordinary boxy-looking station wagons, the Sportabout's design featured a low sloping roofline in the rear and tight overall dimensions. The Gucci versions came with the designer's signature red and green trim colors on well-padded beige-upholstered seating and on the interior door panels. The Gucci crest appeared on the inside front door panels and on the front fenders, while the "GG" trademark was on the headliner. Exterior color selections were limited to Snow White, Hunter Green, Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan. The Gucci trim option package was selected on 2,584 Sportabouts produced during 1972. Additionally, a Sportabout was commissioned by Gucci for his personal use and to showcase some of his other automotive ideas. The exterior grille featured a Gucci motif, transparent covers over the front lights wrapped around the sides, and the rear trim panel had horizontal red and green stripes on a gray cloth insert.

						For 2011, Gucci and Fiat unveiled special versions of the Fiat 500 featuring characteristic stripes inside on the seat belts, seat upholstery, shifter, floor mats, and key fob. The exterior includes green and red stripes below the window line and wrapping around the back as well as 16-inch wheels with Gucci’s interlocking-G logo on the center caps. Available in white with matte-finish chrome trim or in black with glossy chrome accents, the small car includes leather trim and other designs "to make it feel like a Gucci handbag." The hatchbacks were joined by the 500C by Gucci featuring a sliding cloth roof with a green-red-green Gucci stripe. The Gucci versions of both the regular 500 and the cloth-top 500C were again available in 2013.

						Introducing the collection of ready-to-wear and accessories that takes its cue from the Dapper Dan archive created with the House’s refined materials. Featuring a new yellow Gucci logo, the pieces were shot by Ari Marcopoulos on young faces from Harlem. Exploring the synergy of design between Dapper Dan and creative director Alessandro Michele, the new collection of ready-to-wear and accessories features tracksuits in luxurious fabrics, denim with late 80s washes and fits and GG canvas jacquard jackets.

						Gucci has also had a partnership with UNICEF since 2005. Gucci stores worldwide donate a percentage of the sales for special collections made specifically for UNICEF to go toward the United Nations Children's Fund. The annual Gucci Campaign to Benefit UNICEF supports education, healthcare, protection and clean water programs for orphans and children affected by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. For the campaign in 2009, Michael Roberts promoted a children's book, "Snowman in Africa" with proceeds going to UNICEF. In five years, Gucci donated over $7 million to UNICEF.
