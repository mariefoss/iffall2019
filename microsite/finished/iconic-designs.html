						Gucci is known for its iconic handbags. The company made handbags of cotton canvas rather than leather during World War II as a result of material shortages. The canvas, however, was distinguished by a signature double-G symbol combined with prominent red and green bands. After the war, the Gucci crest, which showed a shield and armored knight surrounded by a ribbon inscribed with the family name, became synonymous with the city of Florence. Gucci's distinctive lines made its products among the most frequently copied in the world in the early 2000s. Pigskin, calf, and imported exotic animal skins were subjected to various methods of fabrication. Waterproof canvas and satin were used for evening bags. Bamboo was first used to make handbag handles by a process of heating and molding in 1947, and purses made with a shoulder strap and snaffle-bit decoration were introduced in 1960. In 1964 Gucci’s lush butterfly pattern was custom-created for silk foulards, followed by equally luxuriant floral patterns. The original Gucci loafer was updated by a distinctive snaffle-bit ornament in 1966.

						Gucci handbags for women mix signature lines with diverse designs like totes, top handles, shoulder bags and belt bags in leather and precious materials. From the creative success stories born from war-time material rations to the new-era creations inspired by vintage heirlooms, Gucci’s history is rich in timeless, sentimental and spectacular bag designs. Today, the GG Supreme (as the patterned canvas is now known) reigns, well, supreme across a host of the most popular Gucci bags, from the classic Boston to the new Ophidia.

					<h2>SHOES</h2>

						Gucci's stores featured such finely crafted leather accessories as handbags, shoes, and his iconic ornamented loafer as well as silks and knitwear in a signature pattern. They are of course also known for their iconic sneakers, and more recently, increasingly adventurous shoes including sneakers and heels.

						Together with three of his sons, Aldo Gucci (1905–1990), Vasco Gucci (1907–1975), and Rodolfo Gucci (1912–1983), Gucci expanded the company to include stores in Milan and Rome as well as additional shops in Florence. Gucci's stores featured such finely crafted leather accessories as handbags, shoes, and his iconic ornamented loafer as well as silks and knitwear in a signature pattern.
