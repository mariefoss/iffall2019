		[Verse 1]
	<br>
		There's something about your touch
		<br>
		That's changed the way I see
		<br>
		I can't believe I was so blind
		<br>
		To things right in front of me
		<br>
	</section>

		[Chorus]
		<br>
		If you're a bird, I'm a bird
		<br>
		Let's fly away, together
		</section>
		<br> <section>
		[Verse 2]
		<br>
		There's something about your presence
		<br>
		I can feel when you're close by, baby
		<br>
		And when the lights blinding me
		<br>
		Its love I cannot deny, no
		<br>
