			<li>My name is Marie Foss, and I am a junior studying Communication Design.</li>
		</font>
			<br><br>
			<font size=4 color="D2691E" face="Comic Sans MS">
			<li>I am mostly interested in photography and design, and this class is required for my major. However, I am now extremely excited to learn these skills and this media!</li>
		</font>
			<br><br>
			<font size=4 color="B8860B" face="Comic Sans MS">
			<li>I have absolutely no experience with html or css. I have designed a few websites on WIX, but never with code.</li>
		</font>
			<br><br>
			<font size=4 color="8B008B" face="Comic Sans MS">
			<li>I hope to learn how to build a website or screen-based design experience.</li>
		</font>
			<br><br>
			<font size=4 color="2F4F4F" face="Comic Sans MS">
			<li>I expect that the screen offers more opportunites for direct interaction with its viewer.</li>

			<li>A website that exemplifies effective design: <a href=https://makaylamadden.com/homepage>https://makaylamadden.com/homepage</a>. I think this site is beautifully designed in terms of layout and visual hierarchy. It has a nice text-to-image ratio, especially considering its subject matter. I also appreciate how clear and straightforward the site and its navigation are.</li>

			<li>A website that exemplifies effective communication: <a href=https://www.monicacaughlinphotography.com>https://www.monicacaughlinphotography.com</a>. I like how this website provides a clear idea of the brand and function of the website, as well as the company, all on the homepage. There is a good breakup of space, which allows each section to be read with clear hierarchy.</li>

			<li>A website I think works well: <a href=https://www.pentagram.com/>https://www.pentagram.com/</a>. Pentagram's website not only presents a beautiful design, but it also works in a clear and functional way. I am impressed by the attention to details, including the way a title under a photo changes to its description when you hover over the picture. Additionally, each link leads to a portfolio-styled page that presents text, video, and image seamlessly, leaving the user with little work to do besides scroll. </li>
